Hello, I am a monkey who can't code. Join with me on my journey as I use ChatGPT to create random programs to do useful things.

Rules:
1. ChatGPT must write every line of code. However, placeholder values can be edited with real ones if that is the intended function, ie. directories, credentials, paths.
2. All instructions made by ChatGPT must be followed exactly, even if invalid/nonsensical. 
3. Only ChatGPT can be used in troubleshooting. Even if a fix is obvious, you must get ChatGPT to suggest it first.
